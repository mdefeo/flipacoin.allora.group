## Description
This is a demo of a coin-flipper made with vanilla JavaScript and CSS3. 

*The images of the coin were taken from a Google search*

## Demo

## Notes
To test this functionality on hover just to see it flip the coin from front to back, uncomment out these lines in the style.css file:

/*
.coin-flip:hover .coin-flip-inner {
    transform: translateX(-100%) rotateY(-180deg);
}
*/

This was built and tested in Google Chrome, version 111.0.5563.64 (arm64)
